A PHP extension to get real system socket functionality in php userland.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The extension gives you access to plain system sockets library functions without any
overhead and php-resource wrappers. It makes it perfectly usable in a multithreaded / async environment and that's what it's designed for!

More documentation and examples soon... :)
